Ludum Dare 29 Competition Entry

Theme: Beneath the Surface

Submission page: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=3164

SneakyLink - A game about chatting, infiltration and misdirection; about seeing beneath the surface impression and really understanding someone else. 

... in theory, anyway. In actuality, it's a game about chatting, mostly. I spent too long making a window manager in Javascript (!) and making it look pretty, and didn't have enough time to make an actually compelling plot. If conversations seem to abruptly end, that's because I ran out of time to write the rest of it...
