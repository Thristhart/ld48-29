	<p>You are an overworked programmer for our front company, Deadline Web Services.</p>\
	<p>You have agreed to steal penetration testing tools from your company. You have these tools available to send via your chat client.

Keep in mind that a suspicious enough skilled hacker could easily identify the tainted program, and your cover would be blown.</p>\
